                I have grown rather tired of picking them up or running into them in the hallways and such, and was thinking that i might be able to sell them. Plus, how to assess your cards&#039; rarity and condition. So i wanted to know if there were other sites that you could sell individual cards on.

    <h3>What is a 1st edition card?</h3>
    <p>I have grown rather tired of picking them up or running into them in the hallways and such, and was thinking that i might be able to sell them. Original booster boxes sell for thousands of dollars and have been one of the best investments for pokemon cards. Any lists of cards to look out for vs what i should just bulk sell? Selling pokémon cards online might be the best chance for you to get the true market value at the time of sale.</p>
