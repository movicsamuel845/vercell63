    <h3>The most common way to organize pokemon cards is by set.</h3>
    <p>The symbol (シンボル symbol) is a medal handed out to trainers by hoenn&#039;s frontier brains. Every pokemon card has a rarity symbol (with exceptions… like promo cards). To identify the set, look for a little symbol at the bottom of the card, next to the card number. One looks similar to all of the other previous printings of charizard, but carries the number 3/110 and the legendary collection set symbol.</p>
