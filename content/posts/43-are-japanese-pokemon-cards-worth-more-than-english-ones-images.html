                Much like the trainer cards, this kangaskan card was awarded at the 1998 japanese family event tournament. All cards are ones you could reasonably collect, no prize or error cards. Over 1,600 contestants from more than 30 countries are competed in tournaments.(justin sullivan / getty images).

    <h3>Japanese cards are also overall a much higher quality than english cards, and there are many cute cards do you think japanese cards increase in value, overtime more than english cards, in instead of $90 for a booster box, buy a 12 rayquaza jumbo pack box, worth so much more than $90.</h3>
    <p>Is this card worth more money than a normal exeggutor? I had no idea pokémon cards could be worth so much. The early ex cards were actually printed in black and white. Most of them sell the version of the cards in english, and i was wondering if my version of the card (which is in japanese) is worth just as much.</p>

        <p>English cards are worth more money due to the low pull rate for rare cards, you could make your money back and then some with one pack of cards.</p>
